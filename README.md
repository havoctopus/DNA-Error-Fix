DNA-Error-Fix
=============

Several people do DNA tests with multiple DNA companies. While results in general are same, a few test errors and no-calls can be fixed for the same SNP. This tool attempts to fix errors and no-calls comparing multiple DNA files of the same person tested through different companies. The file formats supported are FTDNA, 23andMe and Ancestry DNA.
